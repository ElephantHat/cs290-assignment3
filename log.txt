Tasks: Created & cloned repos. Wrote code required by assignment. Looked up documentation when encountering difficulties. Wasted probably a couple hours trying to make code fit unit tests because I didn't see the announcement about errors in the tests until after speaking to wolfordj. Played with the console in Chrome to see how various operations panned out. Was also performing data recovery on roommate's computer and engaged in IRC conversations throughout the duration. Even though this log spans almos 6 hours, I probably only really spent about 3 hours doing the homework. My ADD-style homework approach probably isn't very conducive to this logging exercise.
